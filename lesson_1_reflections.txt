How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped a lot. I went directly where the differences were.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could check if something that I am thinking now has been thought
    before.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Meaningful versions
    Cons: May lose changes made due to a lack of eletricity;
    - Too many versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it allows the user to track changes between multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: see all the commits made
    git diff: compare to commits actual with previous

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can checkout to a previous commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control of my codes
    Version control of this file
